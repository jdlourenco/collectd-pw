This contrib section comes with jsonrpc plugin.

With jsonrpc plugin, you can connect to Collectd with HTTP protocol and query some information in JSON-RPC.

Those *.curl files are examples of what you can do.
You can try them with run_curl.sh that is a convenience wrapper around curl.

For more information, read the src/jsonrpc*.c files and pay attention to the comments.
